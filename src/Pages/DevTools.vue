        When developing scripts, errors are always possible. To read them in a convenient way, 
        and also get a lot of useful information about the execution of scripts, browsers have 
        development tools.
      </p>
      
      <strong>For development suggested use Chrome or FireFox</strong>

      <p>
        The other browsers, as a rule, they are in a position of "catching up" 
        with respect to the possibilities of embedded development tools. If the error, 
        for example, is in Internet Explorer, then we already look specifically at it, 
        but usually - Chrome / Firefox.
